React App Creation with Vite
I have gained experience in creating React applications using Vite as a build tool. Vite offers a fast and optimized development environment by leveraging native ES modules and faster build times. Here are some of the highlights and benefits:

Fast Development: Vite offers a highly responsive development experience by reducing the initial server startup time and using native ESM support.
HMR (Hot Module Replacement): Vite comes with built-in support for Hot Module Replacement, allowing immediate updates in the development server without full page reloads.
Simplified Setup: Vite provides a straightforward setup for React apps without the need for complex configurations or boilerplate code.
To create a React app with Vite:

bash----
Copy code
# Run the following command to create a Vite React app:
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd my-react-app

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Start the development server:
npm run dev
