# What i learns in react

# React App Creation with Vite
I have gained experience in creating React applications using Vite as a build tool. Vite offers a fast and optimized development environment by leveraging native ES modules and faster build times. Here are some of the highlights and benefits:

Fast Development: Vite offers a highly responsive development experience by reducing the initial server startup time and using native ESM support.
HMR (Hot Module Replacement): Vite comes with built-in support for Hot Module Replacement, allowing immediate updates in the development server without full page reloads.
Simplified Setup: Vite provides a straightforward setup for React apps without the need for complex configurations or boilerplate code.
To create a React app with Vite:

bash----
Copy code
# Run the following command to create a Vite React app:
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# Navigate to the project directory:
cd my-react-app

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Start the development server:
npm run dev

# React Components
I have gained an understanding of React components, their creation, and their usage in building modular and reusable UI elements.

# What is a React Component?
React components are the building blocks of any React application. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be managed in isolation. Components can be functional or class-based, and each component defines what part of the UI should look like based on the input data (known as props) and internal state.

# Props in React
I have learned about props in React, their usage, and how they help in building dynamic and reusable components.

# What are Props?
Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent components to child components in React. They provide a way to customize components and make them reusable with different values.

# How to Use Props
Props are passed to components in the same way as HTML attributes. They can be accessed within a functional component using props and within a class component using this.props.
